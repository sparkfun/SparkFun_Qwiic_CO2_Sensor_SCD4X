	If this is your first time using Arduino, please read through our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide). If you have not installed an Arduino library before, we recommend you check out our [installation guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library).


We've written an Arduino library for the SCD4X sensors to make it easy to get CO<sub>2</sub> data from these sensors along with other settings and features for these breakouts. Users can download the library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for <b>"SparkFun SCD4x"</b>. Those who prefer to manually install it can download a ZIP of the library by clicking the button below:
